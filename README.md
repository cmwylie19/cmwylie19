I'm a developer heavily focuses on the hybrid cloud around **Kubernetes**. I enjoy solving complex problems and finding new things to challenge myself with. I'm a stickler for the fundamentals; TDD, infra-as-code, release pipelines w/ GitOps, promotion through staging environments.  I find solving problems of scale, availability, and networking to be some of the most rewarding. 

Couple other things about me:

- 🔭 Living by the 1% rule, I try to improve my skills at least by 1% every day. 
- 💬 Find my writing in Go, JavaScript, TypeScript and using WASM and gRPC
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email](mailto:casewylie@gmail.com) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/casewylie)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a [blog](https://caseywylie.io)
- ⛴️ CNCF Kubernetes Certs (CKAD,CKA,CKS)
