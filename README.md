I'm a developer heavily focuses on the hybrid cloud around **Kubernetes**. I enjoy solving complex problems and finding new things to challenge myself with. I'm a stickler for the fundamentals; TDD, infra-as-code, release pipelines w/ GitOps, promotion through staging environments.  I find solving problems of scale, availability, and networking to be some of the most rewarding. 

Couple other things about me:

- 🔭 I live by the 1% rule, where, no matter what, i try to improve my skills at least by 1% every day. 
- 💬 Ask me about my raspi Kubernetes clusters with my `Kube-FS` app for Wireless Cameras
- 📫 How to reach me: Email
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a blog and I may be a bit of a workaholic, but I like it. 
- ⛴️ I hold all of the Kubernetes Certs from the CNCF (CKAD,CKA,CKS)
